# Evosim

A basic evolutionary organism simulation built in Unity. Creatures are spawned into a 2D environment, where they move, perceive, and consume energy. Over time, more successful creatures (based on energy levels) reproduce through a simple evolutionary algorithm.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This simulation demonstrates the basic principles of:
- Genetic variation and mutation
- Natural selection
- Neural network-driven behavior
- Survival of the fittest over generations

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Creatures have DNA consisting of traits like speed, vision, size, metabolism, and a simple neural network.
- Creatures expend energy to move and gain energy by interacting with the environment (e.g., finding food).
- Once a generation dies, those that had high energy are selected as survivors.
- A new generation is created from mutated copies of survivors' DNA.
- If no survivors exist, a random generation is spawned.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Unity 2021.3+ (or newer)
- 2D Project Template

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chouaibzaidali/EvolutionSim.git
